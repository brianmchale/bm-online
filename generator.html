    <p><center>The purpose of this endeavor was to create a product that could easily aid in disaster relief. Hurricane Maria had just left the entirety of Puerto Rico without electricity, and we wanted to make something that could be used in these dire types of situations, should they arise. We decided on a low-cost, portable, fully human-powered electrical generator, operated by a crank. Although not a replacement for a functioning electrical grid, it is enough to light a 16-watt, 2000 lumen LED bulb for six hours on a full battery. It can also charge just about any electronic device through its 12V (cigarette lighter) port, which is connected to a 12V lead acid battery. We also attached an Arduino wired to a breadboard to the system and wrote a program that tracked the voltage level in the battery in order to let the user know when the voltage gets below a certain level by lighting up the LCD screen and having it say "LOW BATTERY", a sign to start cranking again.
